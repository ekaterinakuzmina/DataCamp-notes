    "\n",
    "1. Machine learning (ML hereafter) implies making computers \"learn to make desisions from data **without being explicitly programmed**\".\n",
    "2. Supervised ML, unsupervised ML, and reinforcment larning are main types of ML.\n",
    "3. **Supervised ML** serves to reveal patterns of labeled data (e.g., predicting whether an eamil is spam).\n",
    "4. **Unsupervised ML** serves to reveal patterns of unlabeled data (e.g., **clustering** articles or customers into different categories without knowing in advance what these categories are).\n",
    "5. **Reinforcment learning** implies that software agents interact with an environment, optimizing their behaviour based on rewards and punishments. \n",
    "6. **Supervised ML** implies the presence of **predictor variables/independent variables/features** and a **target variable/dependent variable/response variable**.\n",
    "7. The **aim of supervised ML** is to build a model which predicts the target variable given the predictor variables.\n",
    "8. If the **target variable is categorical**, the supervised ML task is called **classification**, if it is **continuous**, the task is **regression**.\n",
    "9. The **practical goal of supervised ML** can be to (1) automate time-consuming and/or expensive manual tasks (e.g., doctor's diagnosis); (2) make prediction about the future (e.g., whether an add would be popular).\n",
    "10. Labeled data can be obtained from (1)existing databases (historical data); (2) experiments; (3) crowd-sourcing. \n",
    "11. In Python, supervised ML can be done with **scikit-learn/sklearn** libraries as well as **TensorFlow** and **keras** libraries.\n",
